## Installation

In your Gemfile: 

`gem 'saucer'

In your project:

```ruby
require 'saucer'
```

## Usage

#### Starting the Driver
Use Saucer to start your sessions
```ruby
@session = Saucer::Session.begin
@driver = @session.driver
```
Optionally you can create options with various parameters to pass into `Session.begin`
```ruby
options = Saucer::Options.new(browser_name: 'Safari', 
                              browser_version: '12.0',
                              platform_name: 'macOS 10.14')
@session = Saucer::Session.begin(options)
@driver = @session.driver
```

#### Finishing the session
You can still quit the driver yourself if you'd like
```ruby
@driver.quit
```
You get some automatic data population if you end the Session
```ruby
@session.end
```

#### Automatic Data Population
To automatically pass in the test name, populate pass/fail and provide exception information:
RSpec doesn't need to do anything, but Cucumber will need to specify the scenario information
in the `env.rb` or `hooks.rb` file.
```ruby
Before do |scenario|
  options = Saucer::Options.new(scenario: scenario)
  session = Saucer::Session.begin(options)
  @driver = session.driver
end
```

#### Session Commands
Saucer provides a number of custom methods as part of the session instance:
```ruby
# Add useful information to a test after initializing a session
@session.comment = "Foo"
@session.tags = %w[foo bar]
@session.tags << 'foobar'
@session.data = {foo: 'bar'}
@session.data[:bar] = 'foo'

# These things should be set automatically, but can be set manually
@session.name = 'Test Name'
@session.build = 'Build Name'
@session.result = 'passed'
@session.result = 'failed'

# Special Features that might be useful
@session.stop_network
@session.start_network
@session.breakpoint

# This will cause an error, but is available as an option 
session.stop

# These things can be done after the session has ended
@session.save_screenshots
@session.save_log(log_type: :selenium) 
@session.save_log(log_type: :sauce) 
@session.save_log(log_type: :automator) 
@session.save_logs
@session.save_video
@session.save_assets
@session.delete_assets
```

#### Additional API Interactions
A more fully featured wrapping of the Sauce API is planned for upcoming releases.
